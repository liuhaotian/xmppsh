Xmppsh, a tiny shell via xmpp. Different from ssh, we can reach our bash using every kind of IM, or even behind the firewall.

Usage:	xmppsh <jid@jabber.org> <pass> <master@jabber.org>
	
	<jid@jabber.org>:	your jabber ID
	<pass>:			password
	<master@jabber.org>	the ID you allow to control xmppsh, Gtalk is OK, too.

Cmd:	
	exit:	quit the entire program
