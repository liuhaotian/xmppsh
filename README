Xmppsh, a tiny shell via xmpp. Different from ssh, we can reach our 
bash using every kind of IM, or even behind the firewall.

Usage:	xmppsh <jid@jabber.org> <pass> <master@jabber.org>
	
	<jid>:		your jabber ID
	<pass>:		jabber password
	<master>:	the ID you allow to control xmppsh
			Gtalk is OK, too.

Cmd:	
	exit:	quit the entire program
